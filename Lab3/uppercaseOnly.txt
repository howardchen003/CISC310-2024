Howard Chen 	Computer Operating Systems Assignment #3 	2/28/24
Four random uppercase letters 
The password generated was: NTVG
Guesses:241885
Took:0.02494049072265625 seconds

Uppercase, lowercase, and special characters
The password generated was: 5\4T
Guesses:35037334
Took:3.620403528213501 seconds

It took 181 times as long to crack the password with uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

This assignment tells me that it is better to have different characters in a password than just all one case letters as it makes the password cracking process a lot harder. 
This assignment also taught me that unlimited attempts should not be given to crack a password since even if you had the most complex password it could be cracked given enough attempts and time.
